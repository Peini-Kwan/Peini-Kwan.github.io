With a BSc (Hons) in Architecture and over seven years of professional experience, the discipline has equipped me with a strong foundation in systems-oriented approach to complex problems, design problem-solving, and navigating critical constraints.

While I value the design discipline and problem-solving skills developed through architecture, I have grown increasingly curious about how emerging technologies are reshaping the way we design, analyse, and build.

Meanwhile, motivated by the rapid advancement of AI technologies and data-driven tools, I completed a part-time data science course in 2023 to gain exposure to data analysis and computational approaches. This experience not only strengthened my interest in technology but also exposed me to new ways of approaching problems beyond traditional architectural practice, especially in the context of AI and digital tools. which marked my first formal step into the tech domain.

Bridging Design and Data
======
Upon completing of the course, it confirmed my interest in technology as a powerful tool for innovation across industries. I am now focused on building a solid foundation in computing to formalise this way of thinking through algorithms, data structures, and computational methods, and to apply these skills to a wide range of real-world challenges.

My goal is to contribute to smarter, more adaptive industries by extending my domain expertise through computing, AI, and digital systems. Through formal training, I aim to complement my professional background with the technical depth required to engage deeply with data-driven systems, enabling me to apply intelligent technologies across diverse and complex application domains

Driven by an interest in understanding data and analytical thinking, I am now seeking rigorous, structured training in technology to build the necessary technical depth and to apply intelligent systems in practical and industry-driven contexts.
