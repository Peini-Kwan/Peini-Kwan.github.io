The North Face Sentiment & Topic Analysis (Amazon)

Overview:

A comprehensive NLP project investigating customer sentiment and product feedback for The North Face (Men's Section) on Amazon. This study bridges the gap between raw star ratings and actual customer satisfaction by uncovering hidden themes in textual reviews.

The Challenge:

Star ratings often mask true customer sentiment. Some users give high ratings but write negative reviews to "rank" their feedback higher. I used data science to uncover these discrepancies and identify the core drivers of customer choice.

Methodology & Tools:

Data Acquisition: Web scraping via Selenium.
Sentiment Analysis: Comparative analysis using VADER and RoBERTa (Deep Learning) to classify reviews into Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
Topic Modeling: Employed LDA, LSA, and BERTopic to extract key themes like "Product Quality" and "Pricing."
Deployment: Developed an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time review testing.

Key Insights:

Rating vs. Sentiment: Identified products with high star ratings but low "compound scores," revealing strategic reviewer behavior.
Business Impact: Mapped specific customer pain points to brand advocacy and product validation strategies.
